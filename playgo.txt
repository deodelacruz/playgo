func goThread() {

mut.Unlock
}

Write a program which prompts the user to enter a floating point number and prints the integer which is a truncated version of the floating point number that was entered. Truncation is the process of removing the digits to the right of the decimal place.


func trunc(floater float64) int {
     return int(floater)
}

// ways to read input from stdin

reader:= bufio.NewReader(os.Stding)
input,_ := reader.readString('n')

----
scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
for scanner.Scan() {
    fmt.Println(scanner.Text())
}

if scanner.Err() != nil {
    // handle error.
}
